        <p><strong>The flu</strong></p>
        <p>Oh the joys. I felt the first symptoms of coming down with something on Monday. Somehow I coughed and struggled through a four hour workshop that had already been postponed a few times and pretty much collapsed into bed immediately after dinner. You know, man-flu.</p>
        <p>Seriously though, this is the third time in a couple of months that I have fallen sick. I do think that generally speaking I do take care of myself, but the situation at work is getting to me more and more. I neglected the first two outbreaks and went back to work relatively fast. This time hopefully I'm smart enough to take some rest.</p>
        <p>So far I'm proud of myself. I sleep <em>a lot</em>.</pm>
        <p>I've spent my waking hours reading "<em>The Ecotechnic Future</em>" by John Michael Greer. Good read, but depressing. Which is why it is important I read it. The book discusses visions for how our industrial civilization will change in a world after peak-oil. It is scary, but it also highlights very well how the current system is unsustainable.</p>
        <p>Is anyone else also tired of this word, "sustainable"? Well there is no helping it, actual sustainability is non-negotiable.</p>
        <p>I'll bring the book up again in a later post. Today I'm about a third through and it feels premature to talk about it.</p>
        <p>What else have I been up to... mostly bashing my head against IPTABLES. :(</p>
        <p>In my selfhosting setup I'm providing a few apps to myself and my wife: A wiki, a taskboard, RSS reader, data synchronization, ad-blocker. They're all accessible from within our appartment. But I want to be able to access them from anywhere, but without exposing them to the internet.</p>
        <p>I'm already hosting a VPN network for us which is working well. So the idea is to provide the selfhosted apps on the VPN by means of clever routing and a reverse proxy.</p>
        <p>The task for now is to forward DNS requests to our adblocker: From the wireguard VPN network to the adguard instance which shares a docker network with the wireguard client on our gateway machine that provides the single access point from the outside world into our LAN.</p>

        <p>(by the way, <a href="https://www.utf8-chartable.de/unicode-utf8-table.pl?start=9472" target="_blank">UTF-8 border characters</a> are awesome)</p>
        <p>But man, IPTABLES are hard. I know only very little about networking itself so writing these rules is more guesswork than anything else. I've been reading loads of documentation and asked for help on reddit but so far I'm not really making progress. It is frustrating. I've been at this for a couple of weeks now. Granted, usually I have an hour of consecutive time and a complex subject like this isn't really suitable for that. Now that I'm down with the flu I do have more time but my brain is in power saving mode so it's not any easier.</p>

        <p><strong>Spot the mistake</strong></p>
        <p>Simplicity can mean different things to different people. I particularily like this one:</p>
        <blockquote>A simple solution has elegance. It is the result of exacting effort to understand the real problem and is recognized by its compelling sense of rightness.<br/>
          <br/>
          <u>Charles H. More, Inventor of Forth</u>
        </blockquote>
        <p>A simple tool allows us to achieve mastery with it, to fully understand its capabilities and its limitations. Fully understanding the limitations of a tool sparks creativity.</p>
        <p>If you're curious what that could mean, consider guitarists. Six strings and a couple of frets is all their tool, the guitar, has. Yet there is a vast variety of guitar music in the world.</p>
        <p>A digital example is old 8-bit computer graphics and how far Masters of the art pushed it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMcJ1Jvtef0" target="_blank">throughout the years.</a></p>
        <p>My own <a href="https://github.com/MrOnak/cli_todo" target="_blank">CLI todo application</a> falls well within what I consider a simple tool. It does what I need it to do, and no more. 50 lines of shell script is all that was required for it. With some calls to <em>man</em> I will always be able to understand every aspect of it and change it if needed.</p>
        <p>In the same vain, I can relate to the appeal of websites driven by Markdown. Where the content is stored in human readable text files rather than SQL databases, rendering into modern websites on the fly with the help of a tool chain. In fact, when I started to think of creating Laniakea, I did some research into static site generators, and eventually decided <em>fuck it</em> I'll write everything by hand.</p>
        <p>Why is that? I couldn't find a tool chain that was simple and that did Markdown to HTML conversion in a way that I liked. I'm sure there is something out there and I simply didn't look hard enough.</p>
        <p>But what I found was a very different understanding of 'simplicity'. Take <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> for example. It is the site generator used by Github Pages but you can use it yourself, there even is a docker image. I do like docker images. Unfortunatelly the default docker image is over 300 megabyte. Excuse me?! I'm sure Jekyll can do amazing things while converting Markdown to HTML, but 300 MB is... a lot. There is complexity under the hood that no average being will ever grasp.</p>
        <p>On the other end of the spectrum we find a hand-crafted docker image of <a href="https://lipanski.com/posts/smallest-docker-image-static-website" target="_blank">busybox httpd</a> that is smaller than 100 <strong>kilobyte</strong>. Now, that is simple.</p>
        <p>I don't mean to bash on Jekyll. It merely represents one end of a very broad spectrum. Other static site generators come in much slimer: Grav for example is below 50 MB and Jekyll's own 'minimal' docker image is around 70 MB. Still not exactly featherweights though.</p>
        <p>If I were to replace a database-driven website such as Wordpress with one based on Markdown, then it isn't because I want to get rid of the database. I understand databases, I know how to handle them, how to do backups. If I were to do this, it would be to get rid of complexity. Exchanging one complex tool with another one isn't doing anything.</p>
        <p>Of course, this is me. If you do not understand databases and instead are a master with Node.js, your perspective might well be a very different one.</p>

        <p><strong>Musings about simplicity</strong></p>
        <p>In summer last year I did realize how very complex and <em>off</em> my life had become. My password manager listed several <em>hundred</em> entries. I used to have over a dozen gmail accounts. Multiple redundant accounts for services I rarely used. People linked on social media that I couldn't remember how I met them and why we were linked.</p>
        <p>I spent hours daily mindlessly looking at Instagram posts and websites, deleting countless emails selling this or informing me about that, on one site or another. For what?</p>
        <p>What I didn't spend time on anymore were real people or any real-life activity for that matter. The COVID-19 pandemic certainly didn't help, but I was never very social.</p>
        <p>Yet, there was and still is that dream of turning my, our, life around. Reconnect with reality and other human beings. We want to simplify our lives, focus more on people and things that matter. Develop skills. Move to a smaller place, out of the city and into a more rural setup. Buy less, make more. Be less dependent on the internet and big tech. Walk the road toward being more eco-friendly. Reduce our amount of waste, electricity- and water consumption. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/01/i-disconnected-from-the-electric-grid-for-8-months-in-manhattan/?utm_source=pocket_saves" target="_blank">This article is very inspiring</a></p>
        <p>Some tiny steps have been made since then. I realized that I need to clean up my digital life first, to make mental room for any change. I've spend decades creating this current state. It will take some time to untangle, reduce, simplify, identify and keep only those parts that are worth keeping.</p>
        <p>So probably, on the outside not much has changed yet. But I have...</p>
        <ul>
          <li>...stopped gaming, with the exception of one mobile game.</li>
          <li>...delved into the rabbit hole of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosting" target="_blank">self hosting</a>. Move stuff out of the cloud and back onto a machine that I own, administer and mold to my needs. This journey has just begun, there is still plenty to clean up, downgrade, simplify. Currently this has made my life more complex. I'm learning, trying, changing things. This complexity is temporary.</li>
          <li>...deleted a dozen or so email accounts</li>
          <li>...unsubscribed from Twitter and every Facebook / Meta platform and service that I used. By doing so I have temporarily lost a few relevant people but I have gained time and mental space. I will reconnect.</li>
          <li>...gotten off a few online services and wrote a few tools <a href="https://github.com/MrOnak/cli_backup" target="_blank">on</a> <a href="https://github.com/MrOnak/cli_todo" target="_blank">my</a> <a href="https://github.com/MrOnak/c_rpncalc" target="_blank">own</a>.</li>
          <li>...collaborated in tiny capacity with <a href="https://github.com/MrOnak/madness" target="_blank">a</a> <a href="https://github.com/MrOnak/lldap" target="_blank">few</a> open source projects</li>
          <li>...moved largely to Raspberry Pis and text-based applications as my computing platform. My main computer including 2 monitors, mouse, keyboard and desk light now consumes around 13 Wh compared to 150 Wh before.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Regarding non-virtual / digital things: I've gotten rid off an aquarium that I had gotten during the onset of COVID. I've started to learn how to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soroban" target="_blank">Soroban</a> for calculus and I plan to build my own. I had tried to grow some herbs, chilis and paprikas on the balcony. That was largely unsuccessful, I need to learn how to work with the seasons better and be more conscious to cook with ingredients in mind that are currently available.</p>
        <p>I've stopped spending money on my Eurorack synthesizer and largely stopped reading music gear websites, or viewing / watching / following music influencers. I don't need more music gear, time to get off that seductive drip system.</p>
        <p>I've largely stopped buying cheap. I value well-crafted, durable things more.</p>
        <p>I did start to learn aquarell painting and did enjoy it. Recently I have stopped again. This is something to pick up once more in 2023</p>
        <p>I did read one book ("<em>Earth abides</em>" by George R. Steward) last year. Book as in paper.
        <p>We build a small but nice vinyl collection of actually good music. Unsubscribed Spotify and Amazon Music in return.</p>
        <p>My wife has filled one leather bound book with all contact information of all relevant people. She also wrote a whole bunch of christmas cards and stocked up on letter paper.</p>
        <p>I've started to invest our money more and hopefully smarter.</p>
        <p>My mindset has begun to change from wanting the latest shiney gadget, toward viewing simplicity as superior. This is the way forward. But the road is rough.</p>
