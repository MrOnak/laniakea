      <article>
        <h2>why this website?</h2>
        <p>To talk about topics that are of importance to me. To reflect on us as a species in relation to the bigger picture.</p>
        <p>I'm not particularily social. Nor do I think that I have unique bits of wisdom to offer.</p>
        <p>But I do feel that I should, <em>need</em> to add my voice to some discussions.</p>
        <p>Here I don't try to sell things. I won't preach or attempt to convince, but share my views and opinions.</p>

        <h2>Laniakea?</h2>
        <blockquote>Laniakea means ‘immeasurable heaven’ in Hawaiian</blockquote>
        <p>Laniakea is the name of "our" galaxy supercluster. In it, eventually, you will find our planet, earth.</p>
        <p>Make no mistake, Laniakea is unfathomably vast. There is <em>a lot</em> of space for all sorts of things.</p>
        <p>Some orientation, then:</p>
        <p>You're in some sort of settlement, which is in a country, which is on a continent. On earth. So far so good.</p>
        <p><em>Zooming out</em>: Earth is the third planet from the sun, the star in our solar system.</p>
        <p><em>Zooming out</em>: The solar system is one of between 100 and 400 <em>billion</em> similar solar systems in our galaxy, the Milky Way.</p>
        <p><em>Zooming out</em>: The Milky Way galaxy isn't alone. Together with the Andromeda galaxy and both their respective smaller satellite galaxies it does form the Local Group.</p>
        <p><em>Zooming out</em>: The Local Group then joins around 100 other groups to form the Virgo Supercluster.</p>
        <p><em>Zooming out</em>: Lastly, our galaxy and all others in the Local Group join roughly 100,000 others to form the Laniakea supercluster.</p>
        <p>As I said, Laniakea is a vast place.</p>
